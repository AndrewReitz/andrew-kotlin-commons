# Andrew's Kotlin Commons

Things I find myself copy and pasting around. So, I just turned them into a library.
The library currently supports JS and JVM platforms and is meant to be small composable and not have 
any other dependencies.

## Usage

JitPack can be used to try this out for now. Publishing to maven central will occur sometime in the future when
I have more pieces flushed out.

Check out the tests for examples.
